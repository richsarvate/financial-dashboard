- All data processing happens locally in your browser
- API keys are stored securely in environment variables

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

**Can't find Schwab?**
- Make sure you're in "development" mode, not "sandbox"
- Try searching for "Charles Schwab" or just "Schwab"

**Connection fails?**
- Check your API keys are correct
- Ensure you have the Investments product enabled
- Try refreshing and connecting again

**No investment data?**
- Make sure you selected investment accounts (not checking/savings)
- Schwab investment accounts should show up as "brokerage", "ira", or "roth"
